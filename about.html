            <h3>History of the Park</h3>
            <p>The land was originally part of the St Andrews Hall estate before being donated to the city for public use. The park was formally opened in 1923 and has been a community hub ever since.</p>
            <p>In 2015, the park underwent a major renovation funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, restoring many original features while adding modern amenities.</p>
